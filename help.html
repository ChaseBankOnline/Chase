    <h1>Help & Support</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to Chase Online Banking Help & Support.
      Here you can find information to help you manage your account,
      complete transactions, and use online banking features securely.
    </p>

    <h2>Account Access & Login</h2>
    <p>
      You can securely access your account using your registered credentials.
      For your protection, multiple security checks may be required
      before sensitive actions can be completed.
    </p>

    <h2>Payments & Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Chase Online Banking allows you to send money, request funds,
      and pay bills directly from your account.
      Before a transaction is completed, you will be asked to review
      and confirm all transaction details.
    </p>

    <h2>Transaction Confirmation</h2>
    <p>
      To help prevent unauthorized activity, transactions require confirmation
      and PIN verification before processing.
      Always review recipient details, amounts, and notes carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>Security & Protection</h2>
    <p>
      We use multiple layers of security to help protect your information,
      including confirmation steps and authentication controls.
      Never share your login credentials or PIN with anyone.
    </p>

    <h2>Receipts & Records</h2>
    <p>
      After a transaction is completed, a receipt is generated for your records.
      You can review transaction details at any time within your account.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Support</h2>
    <p>
      If you need further assistance, please review the available help resources
      or contact customer support through the official Chase communication channels.
